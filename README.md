# Coffee shop webscraper
This program is just a small python program that grabs all available coffee from a coffee shops website
This is just a webscraping test program so all it does is read out what is available, it does not intereact with the website directly

These files are free-use for anyone and everyone to use and change however they see fit

To run this program you need to have Python installed on your machine, with that you should be able to just run the .bat file as long as you are on Windows OS
